# Advance Sass 

This is a project running with SASS

### Pre-requisites:
Lasted version of NodeJS

#### How to Start: 
```
npm install
npm run compile:sass
```
#### Personal Anotations:
_Fluid Grids And Layouts_

To allow content to easily adapt to the current viewport width used to browse the website. Uses % rather than px for all layout-related lengths.

_Flexible/Responsive Images_

Images behave differently than text content, and so we need to ensure that they also adapt nicely to the current viewport. Need to optimize

_Media Queries_

To change styles on certain viewport widths (breakpoints), allowing us to create different version of our websites for different widths.
